SourceCodeKit INSTALL
=====================

Required software
-----------------

You need to have the GNUstep core libraries installed in order to compile and 
use SourceCodeKit. The core packages are, at a minimum:

   * gnustep-make

   * gnustep-base

See <http://www.gnustep.org/> for further information.

You also need to have the libclang library (along its headers) installed:

    * libclang

See <http://clang.llvm.org/>

Finally you need from Etoile itself:

   * EtoileFoundation, which can be found in Etoile/Frameworks/EtoileFoundation

These last dependency is automatically handled when DocGenerator is built by 
running 'make' tool in the root 'Etoile' directory.


Build and Install
-----------------

Square brackets "[ ]" are used to indicate optional parameters.

If the whole Etoile repository is compiled on GNUstep, libclang is usually 
installed, because Etoile depends on LLVM/Clang (as an Objective-C compiler and 
for LanguageKit).

   Steps to build:

   * make

   * [sudo [-E]] make install


Mac OS X support
----------------

**Warning:** Xcode 4 or greater is required to build the project.

For convenience, SourceCodeKit links to a private copy of libclang.dylib located at:

    /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/lib/libclang.dylib

We have provided the necessary libclang headers in the 'clang-c' directory.
